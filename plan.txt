Random password generator

It has a field for you to enter how many random digits you need (10 is default)
It has button that generates password and text field that displays it

Text field can just displays the password
Or if I work out a way to copy the password to the clipboard:
	Button will copy the password, label will tell the user it has been copied.
	The letters will be asterisks

It has dot selectors that can put numbers, capitals, and punctuation into the password

Just make one big list for the characters. The random number range can be used to determine which characters are included in the selection.
